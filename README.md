# ReLearn

This repo is to help people with "relearning" languages that have become rusty with. Each folder will have the basics of the language and also a notes.txt that contains information that I think is helpful.

If someone needs to learn Python for an internship or interview and then they realize that they forgot how to make an array in Python, they'll need to quickly brush up on their skills, and what's what this repo is for. I know that this exact senario has happened to me multiple times, so I made this to help myself relearn languages quickly. Ideally, I would come here, browse for 5-10 min, do some exercises, then know how to make an array in my desired language.

Will also add frameworks if I have time.
